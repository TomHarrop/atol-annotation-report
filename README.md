# Annotation Reporting Tool

This tool was originally created at the 2025 Biohackathon as part of Project 23: Streamlining Metadata for Biodiversity Genome Annotation (see [fairtracks/biohackathon-2025-project-23](https://github.com/fairtracks/biohackathon-2025-project-23)). Part of the goal of the project was to develop a tool which generates a report-style output summarising the results from QA a genome annotation, e.g. BUSCO, OMArk, and AGAT analyses.

This repo holds the original reporting tool as a Perl script, as well as an adapted reporting tool in Python which is being developed to simultaneously generate a subset of metadata and values which can be used as input to the Australian Tree of Life (AToL) genome-note-lite pipeline.
